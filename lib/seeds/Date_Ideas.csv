This rocky, windswept park overlooking the Pacific Ocean was, at the turn of the 20th century, a hotspot of tourism. Until it was covered by a landslide in 1925,  the Cliff House Steam Rail carried visitors from town out to the coast to swim at the Sutro Baths or have a meal at the scenic Cliff House restaurant. While you can still enjoy tasty provisions (and free popovers with your order) at the Cliff House, you’ll find only ruins of the railroad and former bath, begging to be explored. Walk the popular Coastal Trail to find the hidden Labyrinth at Eagle Point and the mysterious nearby winding path made of stones found only in the Wieliczka salt mines of Poland.",3-4 Hr's,,,,,,,,,,,
