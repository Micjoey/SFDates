                                I stumbled upon this idea when I was trying to figure out date ideas in San Francisco. As I am sure you would have done in the same situation as myself - I went to the best two resources I had: Google and my friends. 

                                Per usual, when searching over the web, there were ideas, but not necessarily the options I wanted. I was hoping to find something that was in between me and my date and also unique. My friends made great suggestions, but once again, I wasn't sure. 

                                I wanted something to suggest to me a date idea based on what date I am on and a convenient location for both parties. 

                                So I created this website. 

                                I hope that this website will allow people in the Bay Area to find date ideas with relative ease. You are on a second date and need ideas in the Richmond district; {<Link to="">we got you</Link>}. Want to go on a hike; we got you. Been dating awhile and want to go on a random date, we got you. 
                            </p>
